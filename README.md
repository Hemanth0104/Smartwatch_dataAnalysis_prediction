Smartwatches have become adaptable instruments for
 ongoing health monitoring in recent years, and their ability
 to provide real-time physiological data holds the promise of
 revolutionizing healthcare. Understanding and projecting the cost
 of smartwatches is essential for consumers and businesses in a
 world where the market for these devices is proliferating. With
 the brand and model as crucial factors, this effort attempted to
 address the problem of precisely predicting smartwatch pricing.
 Four machine learning models are investigated in this research to
 create prediction solutions: Gradient Boosting ((MSE): 23487.86,
 (R²): 0.27), Decision Tree Regression ((MSE): 94115.03 (R²):-1.91), Linear Regression ((MSE): 40830.96, (R²): 0.00) and
 Random Forest model (MSE): 272942.21 (R²): 0.03. Customers
 will be able to make better-informed judgments about what to
 buy and get the most out of their investment. With the help of
 these predictive models, producers and merchants can set pricing
 that is competitive and specifically catered to each brand and
 model. These models, beyond price, provide market intelligence
 that can guide positioning and strategy in the ever-evolving
 smartwatch industry.
